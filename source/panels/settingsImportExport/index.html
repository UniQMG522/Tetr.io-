    <b>Make sure you trust the content pack you're importing</b>
    <p>
      Due to the ever-changing nature of Tetr.io's source code, outdated content
      packs can break the game in unexpected ways. Note that content packs may
      become enourmously large with a lot of songs, and you may have trouble
      importing packs that are more than a few hundred megabytes.

      This is <b>only your Tetr.io+ data</b> and <em>does not include your
      Tetrio settings</em> (e.g. DAS, ARR, graphical settings)
