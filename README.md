Tetr.io block skin changer

## Warnings
**This software is not associated with or created by Tetr.io or osk**

**This is provided AS-IS, it's not terribly polished, its not tested on
anything other than firefox, and its not packaged into a proper extension.**

Currently, only SVGs are supported at the moment, and they must match the format
of [minos.svg](https://tetr.io/res/minos.svg) used by Tetr.io

Other image formats may be supported in the future

## Installing
Installing as a temporary addon for firefox:
- Download zip and extract, or git clone
- Go to [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)
- Click 'Load Temporary Addon' and select the manifest.json file
Note that temporary addons disappear when you completely close firefox.

Installing as a temporary addon for chrome:
- ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (todo)


I'll get around to making a proper signed addon that stays installed eventually
